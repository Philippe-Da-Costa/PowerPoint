  <description>Standard horizontal shooter with stages, bosses, normal and special weapons and flying bonuses. One thing which makes Goldrake Spacer very different from other shooters is operetta-like music.

Nothing can be told about story, because game is made entirely in Italian and there are no Italians currently in CWF roster. If youre one of them you can enjoy the game fully, but as in case of all similar games you can enjoy it anyway without being polyglot - it's playable.</description>
